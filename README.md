# Homework Poster

This repo contains my homework for the course **Scientific Illustration** 2020 at the University Graz, Insitut of Biology.

## LaTeX

The poster was generated with LaTeX code, it does not allow complete freedom in styling but can be used as open source template. Which is the reason why I prefer it.

## Content

Content may change as at the time of the homework the topic presented in the poster is ongoing research work.
